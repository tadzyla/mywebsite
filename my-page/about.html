    <h1> About me </h1>
    <h3> Short story </h3>
    <p> Hello, this is short story about me. I born and grew up in north part of Lithuania. I've been living in one small town with my parents untill 18. Then I moved to the to the ciy
        to study Business Management at the university. Been studying and living there for 4 years. At the third year of my study I met a girl (future wife) at the airport while travelling USA. 
        Since that time we kept the contact until a year later decided to live together in the capital. It was routine life, work, friends, parties, travels etc. 
        Eventualy we decided to change our life and move to UK and search for probably better life. Year after we move we got married, on honey moon we visitied exotic countries 
        and after few years a boy was born. It was happy moments and we wanted another baby, so after another 4 years second baby born. And since then we live as a happy small family.
